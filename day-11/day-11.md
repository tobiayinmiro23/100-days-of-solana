Concept | Traditional Database | Solana Accounts
--------|---------------------|-----------------
Data location | Rows in tables on a centralized server | Accounts on a distributed ledger across validators
Schema | Defined by the database (SQL DDL, document schema) | Defined by the owning program; stored as raw bytes in the account’s data field
Access control | Application-level auth (SQL roles, app middleware) | Enforced by the runtime: only the owning program can modify an account, and only with the required signer(s)
Cost of storage | Server/cloud hosting fees, pay for disk space | Rent-exempt deposit proportional to data size (query via solana rent); refundable when the account is closed
Identity/keys | Auto-increment IDs, UUIDs | 32-byte public keys or Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
Reads | SQL queries, document lookups | RPC calls (getAccountInfo, getProgramAccounts)
Writes | INSERT/UPDATE via application code | Transactions with instructions, signed by authorized keys
Code vs data | Application code and database are separate systems | Both are accounts; programs (code) and data accounts coexist in the same model
Deletion | DELETE query removes the row | Close the account, lamports are returned to you
Visibility | Private by default; you choose what to expose | Public by default; anyone can read any account’s data
